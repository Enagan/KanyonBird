# Kanyon Bird - A Global Game Jam 48 Hours Project

Kanyon Bird features the exiting voyage of a bird as he attempts to reach the end of a canyon alive.
The game was made in 48 hours for the Global Game Jam event (http://globalgamejam.org/), with the goal of being QWOP (for the awkward controls) mashed together with Flappy Bird (for the bird.. and the flapping), but in 3D!
I had the pleasure to work alongside Madalena (Concept and UI Art) and André (3D Art) in this jam.
Each source file is commented in order to properly explain how the game works as a whole.

## How to Play:

- Controller: (Dualshock 4 Recommended, otherwise keybinds will need adjustment)
Move both analog sticks up and down to flap left and right wings (respectively)
- Keyboard:
Alternate between pressing W/S (Left Wing Up/Down) and I/K (Right Wing Up/Down) to flap left and right wings (respectively)

## Unity Requirements

- Running with Unity Version 5.4.1f1
